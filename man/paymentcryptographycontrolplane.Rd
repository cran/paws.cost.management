\value{
A client for the service. You can call the service's operations using
syntax like \code{svc$operation(...)}, where \code{svc} is the name you've assigned
to the client. The available operations are listed in the
Operations section.

\description{
Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage
encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations.
You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can
also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For
more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html}{Identity and access management}
in the \emph{Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.}

To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and
associated cryptographic operations, you use the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html}{Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane}.
You can perform actions like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify
payment-related data.

All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed
and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you
always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.

Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control
plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and
related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to
an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information collected by
CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to Amazon Web
Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made,
and so on. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most
recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see the
\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/}{CloudTrail User Guide}.
