\item{ChangeSet}{[required] Array of \code{change} object.}

\item{ChangeSetName}{Optional case sensitive string of up to 100 ASCII characters. The change
set name can be used to filter the list of change sets.}

\description{
Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single \code{ChangeSet}, you can't start the same change type against the same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a \code{ChangeSet} is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will receive a \code{ResourceInUseException} error.
